# Hello World CRUD Demo

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple "Hello World" software with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using JavaScript and browser localStorage. The goal is to practice basic software engineering skills, including UI, data storage, and code organization, as a foundation for more advanced modules.

- The app lets you display, update, and delete a "Hello World" message.
- It simulates database operations using localStorage (no backend required).

## Purpose
To reinforce my understanding of CRUD operations and web development fundamentals, and to ensure my development environment is set up for future projects.
